					Helping Your Dog With Separation Anxiety
				</h3>
				<h1>
					Dogs are very social, and when they are alone, they can sometimes
					become restless and nervous or even panic. Dogs with separation
					anxiety may destroy things (themselves included), try to escape, bark
					and/or have housetraining accidents. Your dog does not do these things
					"to get back at you for leaving", he or she is simply venting nervous
					energy in the only way he can. For some dogs, being alone for even a
					few seconds is terrifying. You will need to teach your dog that it is
					okay to be alone in small, easy steps. If your dog is so fearful that
					he is in danger of hurting himself, consider finding a veterinary
					behaviorist to help you with this problem.
					<br />
					Also, we recommend finding a trainer certified to work with Separation
					Anxiety using the techniques designed by Malena DeMartini. The most
					difficult part of this training program is avoiding going past your
					dog's current comfort level for being left alone during your daily
					routine. For example, if today your dog is nervous about being alone
					for more than 5 minutes, try not to leave him for more than 5 minutes.
					Each time your dog is left longer than he is comfortable, you will be
					setting your progress back. However, If you must leave your dog for
					longer than he is ready for, at least do not leave him in the spot you
					are working on as his long-term safe place for him. Instead, use the
					original "scary" place or even better, find some way to take him with
					you or leave him with a friend or at a doggy daycare. This plan is
					best accomplished during a vacation, but if that is not possible, you
					can start on Friday before the weekend.
					<br />
					Training Plan Overview: - It will speed up the process if you leave
					him in a spot that he has not been left in before. Place your dog in
					his new Safe Zone (a crate or pen or gated area), give him a
					food-stuffed toy and then go just barely out of sight while you chat
					with him. Set up a webcam or other recording device so that you can
					monitor his anxiety level.
					<br />- Place your dog in his Safe Zone, give him his chewy. When he
					is calmly chewing, sneak out of the room, get your keys, and exit your
					home for just a second. Return to the room at the end of a gradually
					increasing time period.
					<br />- When you return, switch off the recorder and calmly enter his
					area. - If when you return you see signs of anxiety, cut the time you
					stay away in half next time. If when you repeat, he's still
					experiencing separation anxiety, cut your time in half again! Once
					your dog is no longer anxious, start increasing the times again. -
					Gradually build up the time you are able to leave your dog calmly.
					Leave him with a favorite chew each time.
					<br />
					Tips: Practice getting your jacket, keys, etc. at random times
					throughout the day to teach him that this is no big deal. Practice
					positive training for tricks or obedience to help build his
					confidence. Make sure your dog has 30 min to 1 hour of exercise per
					day to help him to relax when you are gone. Reinforce calm behavior by
					giving him extra attention when he is relaxed. See your veterinarian
					to rule out underlying medical cause or for additional help. Sometimes
					medication is needed to help your dog get through this. Feed him the
					healthiest diet that you can afford. Check out the products we offer
					to help your anxious dog! Happy Training! -Jess

				<h3 className="training-title">Train Your Dog to Stop Digging</h3>
				<h1>
					Your dog may be digging for any number of reasons - the main one being
					that it is "working" for her. In other words, she is getting something
					she needs or wants out of the digging. Perhaps she is trying to
					escape, entertain herself, get rid of excess energy, find a lost bone,
					get cool by making a hole to lay in, catch critters, visit China.. who
					knows! Enough speculation, let's solve the problem! First, make sure
					that she is not allowed in the yard unsupervised. I know this can be
					difficult if you have become accustomed to giving your dog lots of
					free time in the yard, but a habit cannot be overcome if it is allowed
					to continue. Go out in the yard with her. If you see her digging
					calmly say "enough" or whatever comes naturally to you. If she stops,
					say "thank you". If she continues, say "time out", go and get her
					(hint: have her drag a piece of rope if she is difficult to catch),
					bring her in the house and be really boring for a few minutes. When
					you do a Time Out, it is best to be very calm so that you don't
					accidentally teach her that you are scary. It is also important to set
					her up for success by making sure that when she is outside she has
					something really important to do, like hunting for her breakfast.
					Scatter her kibble all over the yard or fill treat toys for her. Maybe
					a fresh/frozen marrow bone would do the trick. You might also consider
					creating a legal "digging zone" by setting aside part of your yard and
					burying some treats and encouraging her to find them. You could also
					make a digging zone using a kiddie pool and play sand. When she digs
					in the "wrong" area, she will get a calm Time Out, and if she digs in
					the "right" area she will get treats and praise.

				<h3 className="training-title">Dog Training Tips</h3>
				<h1>
					"Any time you are with your dog, one of you is being trained. It is
					better to be the trainer than the trainee." - Steve White <br />
					<br />
					Treats: Make "˜em small (just enough to taste)! This is the easiest
					way to communicate to your dog that he did something right, (but we
					will use other methods too). The dog should believe that you could
					have a treat at any time and it just might be something REALLY
					AWESOME! I strongly suggest putting a treat container in the main
					rooms of the house so as not to miss any good opportunities for
					reinforcement and always carry treats on walks. Fresh treats such as
					meat or cheese are useful when working in more distracting
					environments. Don't give it away for free: get some training out of
					his feeding, his walks and playtime.
					<br />
					ALL GOOD THINGS COME FROM YOU: By asking for good behavior before
					giving your dog the things he likes you can demonstrate your
					leadership without using force. REMEMBER: your attention is a REWARD
					(sometimes even if you are yelling!).
					<br />
					MYTH: Dogs should behave out of a selfless "desire to please" and
					respect, and not for treats. This myth has hurt a lot of dogs, and
					trainers who don't use reward-based training are using punishment
					(choke chains) to motivate the dogs and not really "respect". We have
					to deliberately demonstrate to the dog WHY he should listen to us (we
					have the food, the toys and the fun!). Think about what you want your
					dog to do rather than what you don't want him to do. Then prevent him
					doing what you don't want and reward him doing what you do want. Get
					it? Teach him some words to help communicate what you want such as
					"leave it", and "drop it". USE PUNISHMENTS VERY CAREFULLY (they don't
					usually work). Never strike your dog.
					<br />
					Train in 5 minute sessions, 3 times (or more, go nuts!) per day. Also
					be aware that you are always teaching your dog how to behave by your
					response to his behavior. Run your dog every day until her tongue is
					hanging out. Twice if she's still got too many "ants in the pants".
					<br />
					HELP HIM LIVE LONGER. Feed your dog a premium human grade diet such as
					Innova or Wellness with fresh supplements. Avoid over vaccinating and
					excess flea and tick repellent chemicals. Clean teeth and ears once a
					week, bathe and trim nails once per month. All dogs HAVE THE POTENTIAL
					TO bite. That's why it's important to teach your dog to be comfortable
					in all situations and to be gentle with his mouth.
					<br />
					MYTH: "Kids and dogs are great together". Actually kids are the most
					likely to be bitten (and this happens TOO often) because they
					accidentally do things that frighten dogs or they act like "prey".
					Never leave a dog and child unsupervised. Teach children not to
					approach a dog that is unknown to them, or when an adult is not
					present. your dog is always learning (and so you are always
					teaching/training). You will need to refresh the cues that you teach
					your dog throughout her lifetime. Happy Training!
